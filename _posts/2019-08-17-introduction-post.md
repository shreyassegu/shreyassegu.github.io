## Learn through Teaching

We might feel that we know a certain topic or a subject well, until we try to teach the same to someone who has no idea about it. We realize that the knowledge we had isn't clear at all, we lack knowledge in depth. It is said that pride gets in the way of good learning, same as ego, But we need to admit sometimes that 'I don't know', Realization is a key factor for performance and improvement.

I'm experiencing the same as I go through writing this blog, I just know that learning through teaching is very effective, I'm not able to elaborate on that fact.

But, some things are a given bonus, we get to evaluate ourselves on our current understanding of a subject

## Information Gained

The information which we gain after the process of teaching **sticks with us**, and the quality of knowledge is very different as well, the information which we gain will be deeper, we can understand and relate to certain decisions and grow intellectually rather than gaining raw information.

## Expertise into a field

Writing a book requires skill and expertise in a field, in order to write a book the author must have spent so much time researching about a particular subject or field to gain enough knowledge to embody all the information in a digestible package for everyone to understand.

>**Famously called the 10,000 Hour rule** - The key to achieving world-class expertise in any skill, is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing the correct way, for a total of around 10,000 hours

So by reading books, we gain valuable insights and knowledge about a subject from someone who is quite skilled at it, it's like a cheat to gain more knowledge faster, so I think cultivating the habit of reading books is always a good idea.
