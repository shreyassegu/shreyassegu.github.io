> “If you want to learn something, read about it. If you want to understand something, write about it. If you want to master something, teach it.” -Yogi Bhajan


## Learning through teaching

We might feel that we know a certain topic or a subject well, until we try to teach the same to someone who has no idea about it. We come to a realization that what we thought we know isn't clear at all, we lack knowledge in depth, and we come across questions that we would have never thought of if we weren't teaching it to someone else

## Information gained

The information which we gain after the process of teaching sticks with us, and the quality of knowledge is very different as well, the information which we gain will be deeper, we can understand and relate to certain decisions and grow intelectually rather than gaining raw information 

## Expertise into a field

Writing a book requires skill and expertise in a field, in order to write a book the author must have spent so much time researching about a particular subject or field to gain enough knowledge to embody all the information in a digestable package for everyone to understand

>**Famously called the 10,000 Hour rule** - The key to achieving world-class expertise in any skill, is, to a large extent, a matter of practicing the correct way, for a total of around 10,000 hours

So by reading books, we gain valuable insights and knowledge about a subject from someone who is quite skilled at it, it's like a cheat to gain more knowledge faster, so I think cultivating the habit of reading books is always a good idea
