In this article I'll share what are the things which I have realized are the most important things to master in order to become a "Great Software Engineer". Full disclosure, I've been working in the software industry for almost a year now, and these are the things which I have observed over the course of my day to day routine and after interacting with a bunch of people.

I'm assuming, you are fresh into the Engineering Degree, eager to learn how to build software and get a great job. Well these are the things which you would need to do in order to stand out!. Be the sheep that stands out from the flock.
## Problem Solving

Starting off with the most important skill to develop. This is a never ending process and you should continue to keep doing throughout your professional life. I suggest starting this first. What do I mean by problem solving? Go get familiar with any programming language, open HackerRank, LeetCode or CodeKatas, get into solving the problems from that platform ASAP.

Problem solving is essentially figuring out how to solve the given problem with the tools which you have, i.e.. The Programming Language which you chose. Doing this will basically introduce you to a bunch of different Data Structures and Algorithms which are a structured way of solving your problems, learning these skills properly will help you in becoming a great software engineer. Getting good at Problem Solving, Data Structures and Algorithms means that you can face the interviews of many Tier-I software companies like Google, Facebook, Apple etc.. Easily as these companies focus a lot on these essential skills.

## Ok so now you want to build software? Where do you start?

Figure out what you want to build, it could either be a website, a desktop tool or a game. This is a stage where you need to figure out what are the tools which you need in order to build what you want. Google is your friend, try to follow through a tutorial or a course, copy whatever they are doing and make it work. At this stage you are still experimenting, figuring out why do you need so many tools and technologies, figuring out how everything works and so on. Follow the instructors step by step, ask a lot of questions and make it work, you will learn something every time you build something and eventually you'll start to make tweaks to the existing things which you would have built from those tutorials, customize it and give it your flavors. Keep repeating this cycle until you get a rough idea on what is going on and it will give you a good foundation of what to do for your personal projects.
The important thing here is to never stop building things, even if they are silly, and don't belong to a particular genre of products, you build a website, you build a game and you build something else. Never stop the process of experimentation as everything you learn along the way will always be valuable.
A good way to start the process is to gather your friends, build something together and figure stuff out together as a group it will be a lot of fun! Start going to coding competitions and hackathons with this group and you will end up learning everything at a very fast rate.

## Obsessing over which language to learn
Learning a lot of languages might seem like a good thing to add to your CV but, what is the use of me knowing c, cpp, c#, java, javascript, go, rust, python, etc etc etc...... What are you achieving here?
At the end of the day languages are merely tools which help you solve a problem, one language is good at solving a particular type of problem compared to another language. Figuring out how to solve a problem is more important than saying I know 15 programming languages.
Once you figure out how to solve a particular problem, you can easily swap out languages, think of it this way, Java and C# are two "screwdrivers", one being manufactured by Oracle and One being manufactured by Microsoft, either of them can be used to solve a given problem but there will be pros and cons for both. The Java might be too expensive to maintain and C# one doesn't give much freedom. This is an entirely different discussion altogether which is out of scope of the current discussion. The gist here is don't spend too much time on deciding these things right now, the current focus is building software for practice, nothing more. Once you experiment with all the different tools which are available you might like the feel of one tool better compared to others, so you can maybe build an expertise on that. The most important thing is keeping an open mind while learning.

## Asking the right questions

You will get stuck most of the time, the key is to figure out the solution to your problem with your best friend Google, It is more than likely that the same problem would have been encountered by many other people, so you can quickly find the solution. Searching for the right answers and asking the right questions is another skill altogether and the only way to get good at it is to make a lot of mistakes. This is the best way to learn

## Communication Skills and good Networking is a must

You may have a tones of skills, but without proper communication skills, you are just like everyone else. Communicating your thoughts, ideas, concerns and solutions is just as critical as any other skill so never neglect it. At the end of the day, you might be a software engineer or an entrepreneur whatever it is that you decide to do in life, good communication go hand in hand, and put you miles ahead of the competition.

You also need to build a good pool of people to get things done, to get advice when you're stuck. A good network directly relates to more opportunities for you. Always be ready to learn things from others, learn from their success and failures and don't hesitate to try new things when given an opportunity. A good way of building a broad network is to start using Linkedin, attending tech meetups, be a part of a community, attend hackathons with your college mates. This will build your confidence, get you exposure to what the industry trends, gets you to meet new people and in turn improve your communication skills, basically everything is a win-win here.
